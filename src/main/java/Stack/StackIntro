push o(1)
pop o(1)
peek o(1)


Stack Implementation

Array

Cons:
- fixed size
- last index = top of stack
if(array size is reached)
stop the push
- not used much because of 
fixed size.

Once reached end of the array,create again new and copy all to new



ArrayList:

- Variable Size
  | 1 | 2| 3| |
           \- top
           push on top 0(1)= set(i+1)
           pop on top o(1)= get(i) and remove
           peek on top o(1)=get(i)


LinkedList:

- Variable Size
 new node is always taken as head
 |1|
 |2|
 |3|-> head pop o(1)= =head=head.next
 peek o(1)=>get head value= head.data
 push newnode.next=head;
 head=new node;
